# Panerus

A simple music authoring program for Javanese Gamelan music.

Named after the Bonang Panerus, the Bonang with the smallest pots, implying that this program is not intended to be a simple program. I'm hoping to provide a way for the National Music Museum to author clean music for their Gamelan Ensamble.
